## SudokuGenerator

A Sudoku solver and generator written for a C++ class on AGH UST. Terribly inefficient. Check main.cpp if you want to use it, or just compile it, it will create a sudoku and a solution. There is also a working demo on http://student.agh.edu.pl/~shyman/sudoku.cgi, which uses still the V1 version which is even more prone to stall then V2.
